ELTE is the best Hungarian university again
Our university ranked 591st in the recent CWUR world rankings, thus maintaining its leading position among Hungarian higher education institutions.
Since 2012, the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) has ranked the world's higher education institutions based on the quality of education, graduate employment opportunities, faculty excellence, research findings, highly cited publications, and citations. (You can read more about the evaluation methodology here.) The 2021–22 ranking surveyed nearly 20,000 universities, including the top 2,000 training places worldwide.

Based on the results of the benchmark ranking, ELTE has maintained its leading position in the Hungarian higher education palette since 2014. This year, our university achieved 591st, ahead of the also listed University of Szeged (678), Semmelweis University (683), University of Debrecen (695), Budapest University of Technology and Economics (887), University of Pécs. (1090), Central European University (1669) and the University of Pannonia in Veszprém (1949).

Eötvös Loránd University is in the same category as institutions such as the Czech University of Technology, the Italian University of Palermo, the French University Paris-Est Créteil or the American Haverford College. Harvard has led the world rankings for the tenth year in a row, this year, the second is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the third is Stanford University. The majority of the top places on the list are still occupied by Anglo-Saxon institutions, with China at the forefront with 277, the United Kingdom with 95, France 79 and Russia 46.
