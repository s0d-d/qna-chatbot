As for research, the following aims have been established: research activities of international standards; a research portfolio complying with national and European recommendations; strengthening research potentials; successful participation on the international R&D market; look for financial sources for research activities; supporting researchers so that they reach results at an international level and in the international dissemination of the results.

To reach these goals, ELTE is building an international network of partner institutions and thus supports teaching and research projects and developments within the institution.
