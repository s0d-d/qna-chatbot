ELTE REMAINS THE LEADING UNIVERSITY IN HUNGARY
In the ARWU 2021 ranking, our University was ranked in the 601-700. category, making it once again the best higher education institution in Hungary.
The 2021 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) has published its ranking of higher education institutions, in which they examined more than 1,800 institutions from around the world, with the top 1,000 making it to the list. Eötvös Loránd University has been ranked in the 601-700. category, maintaining last year's ranking, once again ranking as the best university in Hungary. ELTE's category in 2021 includes the Masaryk University in the Czech Republic, the Nottingham Trent University in the United Kingdom, the University of Giessen in Germany, and the University of South Africa. Three other institutions are in the top 1,000 from Hungary, these are the University of Szeged (601-700.), Semmelweis University (701-800.) and the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (801-900.)

As last year, Harvard, Stanford and Cambridge are at the top of the ranking. Eight American and two British institutions are in the top ten places, while Paris-Saclay University is the best European university (in 13th place). The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) is also among the best universities (at 21st place), as are the University of Toronto (22nd) and the University of Tokyo (24th), while the Tsinghua University is the best ranking higher institution (28th) in China.

The ARWU ranking was first published in 2003 by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and has been conducted by an independent organization, ShanghaiRanking, since 2009. The ARWU rankings have been regarded as one of the most reliable rankings for many years. Based on a transparent methodology and data collected from external partners, the top 1,000 institutions out of 1,800 surveyed are ranked each year, with indicators including the number of publications and highly cited researchers, the number of academic awards won by former students and current faculty members of the institutions.

Detailed results of the ARWU 2021 survey ranked by countries are also available on the ARWU website. News about ELTE's achievements in national and international rankings are collected on the following page.
