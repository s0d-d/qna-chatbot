ELTE RETAINS ITS LEADING POSITION
ELTE retains its leading position
ELTE still holds its leading position among the Hungarian institutions of higher education. According to the higher education rankings for 2019 published recently in a special issue of HVG, Hungary’s leading economic and political weekly, our university is still in the lead in Hungary. ELTE is at the top of the sub-ranking list drawn up on the basis of teacher excellence, and has also achieved a pre-eminent position on sub-ranking lists complied in the fields of humanities, law, education, and science.
ELTE is still ranked as first on the cumulative list of teacher excellence: our university has the largest number of teachers holding the highest level of academic degree or the title Doctor of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (9.33%). In terms of teacher excellence, the ELTE Faculty of Science is at the top on the list of faculties in Hungary, since it has the highest proportion of professors who are Doctors of the Academy (22.46%). ELTE also continues to rank as first on the list of student excellence: our university has the highest number of applicants (7972) who apply here at the first place, and the best students of secondary schools normally choose one of the faculties of ELTE. In Hungary, six faculties of ELTE – the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Humanities, the Bárczi Gusztáv Faculty of Special Education, the Faculty of Education and Psychology, the Faculty of Social Sciences, and the Faculty of Science – have been able to keep the minimum score for admission to the university above 400.

The following aspects were taken into consideration when compiling the ranking lists of institutions: the number of applicants to full-time and undivided higher education programmes at the first place, the average score of applicants, the average number of successful applicants holding language certificates at levels B2 and C1, the number of first-year students who won prizes at secondary school competitions, the number and proportion of teachers holding a PhD degree, the number of full-time students per teacher (with a doctorate), as well as the proportion of teachers holding the title Doctor of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Compared to former years, the teachers’ ranking list was subjected to fine-tuning, and the weighting was modified. This year, in contrast with the 50 percent weighting applied previously, the number of students per teacher with a doctorate was taken into account at the same weight as the ratio of such teachers to the total number of teachers and the proportion of professors holding the title Doctor of the Academy.
